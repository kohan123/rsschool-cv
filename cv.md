    let memory = {};
    let resultDebtors = [];
     for (let i = 0; i < myDebtors.length; i++) {
      let doljnik = myDebtors[i].name;
      if (memory[doljnik] === undefined) {
      resultDebtors.push(myDebtors[i]);
      memory[doljnik] = resultDebtors.length - 1;
   } else {
      const originalIndex = memory[doljnik];
      resultDebtors[originalIndex].money += myDebtors[i].money;
   }
 }

6. I have a small school experience that I got while solving practical tasks.
   For a couple of months I also worked with an experienced programmer who tried to share his knowledge and teach me to solve the assigned tasks.
7. Secondary vocational education.
   I studied at the railway college as a track fitter and operator of a flaw detection trolley.
   Unfortunately, I did not attend courses, seminars and lectures related to programming.
8. I paid special attention to English in college. 
   I had a good teacher who knew a lot about his profession.
   From experience: I passed the 7/10 exam, I study foreign songs, and also tried in every possible way to communicate with native speakers.
